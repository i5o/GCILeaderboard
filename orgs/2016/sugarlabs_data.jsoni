Try to implement a visual \"bounce\", where the ball \"squeezes\" against the edges of its frame visually (...by having the ball squeeze against the side, enlarging in middle as it\nhits the side of the frame like in this picture: http://cdn.xl.thumbs.canstockphoto.com/canstock7154523.jpg )\n\nThe problem that occurs in tempo widget looks a bit like this: http://www.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/166/tjd/_images/overlapBall.png\n\nOther helpful links and info\n=====================\n\nA similar problem is discussed here:\nhttp://www.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/166/tjd/bouncing_ball.html\n\nPertinent Quote:\n> Debugging: Fixing the Problem\n>\n> So we’ve identified the problem, but how do we fix it? This is not completely obvious because there are many ways that we could modify the value of y (or even dy) that might fix it.\n>\n> But lets try to understand a little more what is going on. The first time that the top-edge if-statement condition is true, the image on the screen looks something like this:\n> Interpenetrating ball.\n>\n> The top of the ball goes a little bit into the top edge of the screen, i.e. the ball interpenetrates the edge. The ball and the edge are supposed to be hard surfaces that don’t allow any sort of interpenetration. But our arithmetic allows for them to intersect, and so we have to do something to stop that.\n\nNOTE: This may also be helpful:\n\nhttp://sixrevisions.com/html/bouncing-a-ball-around-with-html5-and-javascript/","tags":["code","design","javascript"],"is_exhausted":true,"has_been_completed_by_user":false,"modified":"2016-12-30T02:25:56Z","max_instances":1,"name":"Improve Music Blocks Tempo Widget","organization_id":5114486142795776,"has_claims":true,"assignments_count":2,"assignments_profile_ids":[4766017729331200,6607123039387648],"available_count":0,"is_beginner":false,"assignments_profiles":[],"id":5330218866704384,"categories":[1],"external_url":null},"last_deadline_pause_remaining_days_abs":2,"modified":"2017-01-01T02:01:29Z","organization_id":5114486142795776,"claimed_by_id":6582647008526336,"comments_count":1,"completion_date":"2017-01-01T02:01:27Z","last_deadline_pause_remaining_days":"2 10:53:36.935930","latest_comment":{},"deadline_to_complete":"2017-01-03T09:54:15Z","id":4659483731034112,"claimed_by":{"program_year":2016,"display_name":"Ziyao Zhang","id":6582647008526336}},{"status":7,"program_year":2016,"task_definition_id":6511793201479680,"deadline_paused":true,"task_definition":{"status":2,"time_to_complete_in_days":3,"assignments_profile_display_names":["Ezequiel Pereira","Walter Bender","Ignacio Rodríguez"],"program_year":2016,"description":"Create a new activity of your own choosing.

Open and merge a pull request\n\nOnce you have completed the tutorial, please:\n\n(a) Create a new branch of your repository called sugarlabs.\n\n(b) Edit the README.md file to include the phrase., \"Hello Sugar Labs\". along with some personal message that includes your name.\n\n(c) Commit the change;\n\n(d) Make a pull request for the change.\n\n(e) Merge that branch back to your master branch.\n\n(f) When you are done, please upload the URL to your repository to complete this task.\n\nNote that this is essentially the same workflow you will use for most of the coding tasks. Rather than creating a new repository, you will often be making a clone of an existing repository to which you will make your changes. Your pull requests will be to the original repository. Sugar Labs community members will do the final merge, but your task will be complete once a mentor has signed off on your pull request.","tags":["git"],"is_exhausted":true,"has_been_completed_by_user":false,"modified":"2016-12-26T18:19:00Z","max_instances":100,"name":"Git Introduction","organization_id":5114486142795776,"has_claims":true,"assignments_count":7,"assignments_profile_ids":[4766017729331200,5639722860806144,6222075463204864,5187728018767872,5835489214988288,6111194171572224,5110787303538688],"available_count":0,"is_beginner":true,"assignments_profiles":[],"id":5651282765283328,"categories":[3],"external_url":"https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world"},"last_deadline_pause_remaining_days_abs":2,"modified":"2016-12-26T18:13:45Z","organization_id":5114486142795776,"claimed_by_id":5669350105153536,"comments_count":6,"completion_date":"2016-12-26T18:07:56Z","last_deadline_pause_remaining_days":"2 08:31:02.191790","latest_comment":{},"deadline_to_complete":"2016-12-29T02:33:15Z","id":4802629462917120,"claimed_by":{"program_year":2016,"display_name":"Eliza Verghese","id":5669350105153536}},{"status":7,"program_year":2016,"task_definition_id":5995644787359744,"deadline_paused":true,"task_definition":{"status":2,"time_to_complete_in_days":3,"assignments_profile_display_names":["Ezequiel Pereira","Utkarsh Tiwari","Sam Parkinson","Piotr Antosz","Ignacio Rodríguez","Vishal Batchu","Chihurumnaya Ibiam","Walter Bender"],"program_year":2016,"description":"Following the instruction at http://developer.sugarlabs.org/dev-environment.md.html, set up the Sugar development environment.
